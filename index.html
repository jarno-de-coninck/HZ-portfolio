    <h1> Jarno de Coninck </h1>
    <p>
        I am 20 years old, and I was born in Knokke. One of my strengths is that I always keep my code neat and
        organized. I am also very creative. I am currently studying software development in college to improve my
        programming skills. My hobbies include making games and going to the gym, and one of my main ambitions is to
        become a professional software developer.
