                    <h3> Learning Through Game Development </h3>
                    <p>
                        A large part of my coding journey started with <strong>Luau</strong>, the scripting language of
                        Roblox Studio.
                        By experimenting with systems, mechanics, and player interaction, I learned how to structure
                        code, solve problems,
                        and bring ideas to life. These projects gave me practical experience that I‚Äôm now building on in
                        web and software development.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="mt-4"> Some Things I Worked On </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Admin panel:</strong> A Roblox management system that lets admins control gameplay,
                            store and modify player data, and use custom commands for fast in-game management.</li>
                        <li><strong>Whispered:</strong> An infinite exploration game with procedurally generated ‚Äúchunks
                            / biomes‚Äù and interactive items like consumables with unique effects.</li>
                        <li><strong>Minesweeper:</strong> A recreation of the classic puzzle game inside Roblox, using
                            Luau scripting to handle grid logic, bomb placement, and reveal mechanics.</li>
                        <li><strong>BlockRunners (Spleef):</strong> A fast-paced multiplayer minigame where players try
                            to survive by breaking blocks under opponents‚Äô feet while keeping themselves safe.</li>
                        <li>Worked with <strong>DataStores</strong> to serialize and persist complex data like notes and
                            metadata.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="mt-4"> Skills I Gained </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Building structured systems in an event-driven environment.</li>
                        <li>Hands-on experience with saving/loading persistent player data using Roblox DataStores.</li>
                        <li>Debugging and testing live multiplayer features.</li>
                        <li>Creativity in designing unique mechanics and environments that encourage exploration.</li>
                        <li>Designing both single-player puzzle logic and competitive multiplayer gameplay loops.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="mt-4">
                        These Luau projects were my introduction to development, and they showed me how much I enjoy
                        creating interactive systems.
                        From building management tools like my admin panel, to experimenting with infinite world
                        generation in <em>Whispered</em>,
                        or designing competitive games like <em>Minesweeper</em> and <em>BlockRunners</em>,
                        I gained both technical and creative skills that I now apply to larger-scale web and software
                        projects.
