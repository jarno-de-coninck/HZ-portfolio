            <h3> From MBO to HBO </h3>
            <p>
                After completing my <strong>MBO in Software Development</strong>, choosing to continue to HBO felt like the natural next step. 
                My MBO experience gave me a solid foundation in programming, teamwork, and practical project work and I genuinely enjoyed it. 
                I learned a lot, built real applications, and discovered that software development was something I wanted to keep pursuing.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-4"> Why HBO? </h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Building on what I know:</strong> My MBO background prepared me well for HBO-level work. I already understood the basics and wanted to deepen that knowledge.</li>
                <li><strong>Passion for development:</strong> Between my education and my game development projects in Roblox Studio, I realized how much I enjoy creating systems, solving problems, and building interactive experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Career growth:</strong> An HBO diploma opens more doors professionally. It gives me access to more opportunities, better positions, and the chance to work on larger, more complex projects.</li>
                <li><strong>Continuing the journey:</strong> I wanted to keep learning and growing as a developer. HBO lets me go deeper into software engineering, explore new technologies, and refine my skills.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mt-4">
                Choosing HBO wasn't just about getting a higher diploma, it was about continuing to do what I love and setting myself up for a successful career in software development. 
                I enjoyed my time at MBO, learned a ton from my game projects, and now I'm ready to take on the next challenge and keep building my expertise.
