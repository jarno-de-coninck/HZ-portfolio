            <h3> Building Skills Through Real-World Experience </h3>
            <p>
                My programming journey has taken me through internships, education, and personal projects. 
                Each experience taught me something different whether it was working with hardware-integrated software, 
                building cross-platform apps, or developing game systems. These opportunities shaped how I approach 
                problem-solving and software development today.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-4"> Key Experiences </h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Internship at Epesi:</strong> Worked with FlutterFlow and Dart to build mobile a mobile app to track football game events, learning rapid prototyping and cross-platform development.</li>
                <li><strong>Internship at Moduvision:</strong> Developed software in C# that interacted with autosamplers, gaining hands-on experience with hardware integration and technical debugging.</li>
                <li><strong>MBO Education in Software Development:</strong> Built foundational projects like Pasimo, QR-Goats, and Slidehub using frameworks like Struts 2, Hibernate, and Bootstrap, working in team environments with Scrum methodology.</li>
                <li><strong>Game Development with Roblox Studio:</strong> Created multiple games and systems using Luau, including admin panels, exploration games, and competitive multiplayer minigames, learning event-driven programming and DataStores.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="mt-4"> Languages & Technologies </h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Languages:</strong> Luau, C#, JavaScript, Java, Dart partially, SQL, HTML/CSS, PHP.</li>
                <li><strong>Frameworks & Tools:</strong> FlutterFlow, Struts 2, Hibernate, Bootstrap.</li>
                <li><strong>Development Tools:</strong> Roblox Studio, Eclipse IDE, VSCode, MySQL Workbench, InteliJ</li>
                <li><strong>Methodologies:</strong> Scrum, version control, debugging, and testing in both solo and team environments</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mt-4">
                From working on cross-platform mobile apps to building hardware-integrated software and creating multiplayer games, 
                these experiences gave me a diverse skill set. I learned to adapt to different languages and environments, 
                collaborate with teams, and solve complex technical challenges. This foundation continues to drive my growth as a developer.
